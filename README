DESCRIPTION:
============
This plugin implements the functionality of ejhopkins' Wild Grass 11.5.1 server mod, 
as well as vines on trees, (partially working) lily pads and mini-cacti on land, 
mossy growth spreading on cobblestone and surface plant spreading functionality 
based on Master-Guy's PlantSpreader plugin. **Note that in order for the players 
to see the wild grass, you must install the client mod.** Of course, the grass 
and/or plant growth can be disabled. Now supports vines!

Version 3.0_beta 25-Apr-2011
* Works on bukkit #714
* Implemented Grow and GrowAll Commands
* Permission: vegetation.grow, vegetation.growall, vegetation.mow
* Implemented Permissions support (2.6 or higher)
* Disabled grass growing since there is no update for the grass mod yet
* Note: This is a test version

Version 2.31_fixed 22-Apr-2011
* Made some performance improvements
* Note: Player commands are not working at the moment
* Note: Biome settings are not working at the moment

Version 2.31 13-Apr-2011
* Recompiled against latest recommended Craftbukkit build #674.
* Fixed another pretty ridiculous bug in the plant growth player-getting subroutine, one which was seriously affecting performance. Should work even more as it was designed to work now. :)

Version 2.3 09-Apr-2011
* Recompiled against latest recommended Craftbukkit build #670.
* Grass grows through snow blocks now. Can't wait until 1.5 comes out!
* Fixed a pretty ridiculous bug in the plant growth percentage calculations. Should work as it was designed to work now. :)

Version 2.21 01-Apr-2011
* Recompiled against latest recommended Craftbukkit build #617.
* Added the ability to have water cause cobblestone to become mossy. Only if the cobblestone is touching the water, obviously.. And of course, normal moss spreading can take over from there if you have that enabled as well.


Version 2.2 30-Mar-2011
* Updated to incorporate new features of Wild Grass 10.1+ -- vines!!
* Changed growth percentages to doubles, so now fractional percentages may be used in the .ini file.
* Added HELL biome to the list of configurable biomes (see above)
* added /growvines # command. For example, /growvines 10 will grow ten random vines within growthRange number of blocks.
* added /vine # command. If you aim at any lower leaf block on a tree and type /vine 3 it will grow a single vine from that block, three blocks tall.
* Recompiled against latest recommended Craftbukkit build #602.

Version 2.11 25-Mar-2011
* Fixed the /growgrass # command handling. Try /growgrass 1000 and watch it grow!

Version 2.1 24-Mar-2011
* Improved the plant spreading code, now my world has way too many flowers. :) Still not seeing any cacti growth, but I do see evidence of canes spreading.
* Grazing animals now will only eat grass that is >3 in height. I will most likely add a grazeHeight setting to the .ini file.
* Added /gg, /growfield and /grass commands (see Usage above)
* Added optional numeric arguments to the /overgrow and /growgrass commands to temporarily change/set the grassPerGrow value to something higher if needed.
* /overgrow now has one plant cycle included per 10 grass cycles (unless growPlants is disabled, of course)
* /mow now sets the surrounding grass level to 3 instead of 1 (completely flat). If you prefer the completely flat look, you can use /growfield 1 to achieve the same effect.
* Removed the obnoxious "Updating player position.." spam from the debug logging

Version 2.0 20-Mar-2011
* Major rewrite of the timer task code. This should greatly help with CPU performance issues.
* /overgrow now only grows around the player who typed it, rather than all players. It also now runs 1,000 growGrass() cycles, and notifies you at 25%, 50%, 75%, and completion, since it takes a while to run.
* Rewrote the way the timer handles the growth tasks - now it is based on a 100-slot timeslot system, so grass/plant/moss/graze amounts can be specified as percentages.
* Removed a few unneeded configuration directives and added some others.

Version 1.5 19-Mar-2011
* Had the idea to add animal grazing. This should help keep the grass down. :)

Version 1.41 18-Mar-2011
* Recompiled against the latest recommended Craftbukkit build #556.
* Fixed the cacti/canes growth.

Version 1.4 18-Mar-2011 *it is recommended that you update to this version or newer*
* Divided the moss, grass, plants, and block manipulation functions into separate Java classes.
* Added /growmoss command.
* Added mossEnabled and mossPerCycle to the .ini settings.
* Rewrote the TimerTask threads to be properly implemented (as classes instead of functions)
* Finally got the mossy cobblestone spreading to work
* I completely forgot to fix the cacti/canes growth, it will be fixed in the next release :)

Version 1.31 15-Mar-2011
* Fixed a serious bug in which it would "grow" half-blocks into other types of half-blocks, or rotate stairs and rails. I apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
* Added the remaining biomes (sans Biome.HELL) to the configuration
* Apparently TimerTask asynchronicity is discouraged, so I changed the timer tasks to synchronous.

Version 1.3 14-Mar-2011
* Rewrote the looping routines again! They actually work properly now.

Version 1.21 10-Mar-2011
* Rewrote the looping routines to be a bit more efficient.
* Fixed a couple more mathematical bugs.
* Discovered and implemented the nifty Block.getRelative(BlockFace.UP) method.

Version 1.2 10-Mar-2011
* Added /overgrow command.
* Recompiled against latest recommended Craftbukkit build #531.

Version 1.1 10-Mar-2011
* Fixed flawed multi-world checking code. :)
* Fixed flawed block-checking code.
* Added more configuration options.
* Added more biomes in which growth may occur.

Version 1.0 09-Mar-2011
* Created plugin.
